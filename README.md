# MTH3199-Assignment-1
FA25 MechE Math Assignment 01

## Overview
This assignment is an introduction to root-finding algorithms - sepcifically bisection, newton, and secant methods. We explore the strengths and weaknesses of each method. Finally, we use the methods to show an animation of an egg thrown towards a wall.

## Root-finding algorithm analysis
To see how the different root-finding methods converge and what guesses they need to converge, run the `main.m` script.

## Tumbling Egg
To visualize an egg thrown at a wall, run the `tumbling_egg.m` script. This shows an animation and also calculates the time at which the egg would reach either the wall or the ground after being thrown.
